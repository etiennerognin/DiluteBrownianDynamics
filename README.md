# DiluteBrownianDynamics

**Dilute Brownian Dynamics** simulation package written in Python, with readability and extensibility as the main goals.
It is primarily intended for toy models in polymer science.

*Dilute* means that molecules are simulated individually, allowing simple data structure (there is no *simulation box*) and
parallel support. A variety of molecule models are already implemented.

Beta version.

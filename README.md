# DiluteBrownianDynamics

Dilute Brownian Dynamics simulation package written in Python, with readability and extensibility as the main goals.

*Dilute* means that molecules are simulated individually, allowing simple data structure (there is no *simulation box*) and
parallel support.

Beta version.
